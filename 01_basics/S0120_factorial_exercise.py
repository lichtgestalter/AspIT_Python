Exercise "factorial":

As always, read the whole exercise description carefully before you begin to solve the exercise.

Copy this file into your own solution directory. Write your solution into the copy.

All you need to know about functions in order to solve this exercise, you'll find in the jupiter notebook S0040_basics.ipynb.

Write a function named "factorial".
Scroll down to find the place in this file, where to write the function in.

The function factorial shall ...
    have one parameter named "number".
    calculate the factorial of this parameter and store the result in a variable named result.
        (If you do not remember the definition of factorial: https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakultet_(matematik) or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
    return the result.

In the main program...
    Write a line of code saving the integer number 5 in a variable called factorial_input.
    In the next line of code call the function factorial with factorial_input as its argument
    and save the result of this function call in a variable named factorial_result.
    In the next line of code print out "5! = 120" using the variables factorial_input and factorial_result.

Run the program. "5! = 120" should be printed in the console.
Change the first line of the main program to "factorial_input = 6".
Run the program again.
This time "6! = 720" should be printed in the console.

When your program is complete, push it to your github repository.
Then send this Teams message to your teacher: <filename> done
Thereafter go on with the next file.
